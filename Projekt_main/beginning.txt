You have no name or surname, you are nobody. You lead the normal life of an isolated introvert who only sits in his cave in front of the computer. 
You decided to leave the house once and that one time was enough. 
You die being hit by a truck because you prefer to look at anime girls on your phone than what goes on the road, because you are a weeb, a loser, a degenerate with no life, nothing new to you.
For your happiness, it is not the end of your journey, you wake up in an empty space with a hooded figure sitting in front of you. 
He only introduces himself to you by claiming to be a great believer in a "true gender equality". 
After he has presented you with the whole situation and what happened, he informs you that there is a way to come back to life, but on one condition...
First you will save, you will liberate another world from final destruction. Some people have been turned into Tuba Man. 
They are possessed people who look like a combination of a man and various wind instruments that they also fight.
Most of the local humanity has already ceased to exist and those who survived hid in order not to join the legion. 
The masked figure said she would give you a choice when it comes to your starting equipment and skills.
