After you have made a choice about your starting class, a mysterious character informs you that your goal is to defeat the main evil, 
or rather the main duo that started it all after entering this world.
They are called "Dunkstein and Slamough", the legendary warriors, even called gods in their culture, who keep all the possessed under a spell.
He also gave you very important information, if you die during this adventure, you die eventually, there is no return, you don't start from scratch, you don't show up at the last fire, nothing.
Your face looked unfazed, but inside you felt fear, dread, dread upon hearing this information, but a few deep ones fixed everything up and you were ready.
Without a moment of rest or asking a question, a mysterious figure takes you to this world. 
Without even knowing when, in much less than a blink, you appeared in this world, very high in the air.
You are overcome with terror, fear but you remember that you have to save this world, as the mysterious figure said, so you probably won't die by falling, 
so... you start doing somersaults in the air, because it's the only thing you are good at.
The last flip you managed to do, you end up like a real "Edge Lord", a typical "SuperHero Landing". 
At the moment of impact, a great wave of air arises, you slowly raise your head with a hateful gaze, and your first words spoken in this world are "This is where the fun begins".

After traveling around this world for a while, you come to the conclusion that this is a typical fantasy world of the medieval times. 
After entering this world, you immediately noticed a great castle which must be the seat of the main evil in this world. 
As you head towards it, you notice a few enemies defending its entrance. 
At this point, you come to the conclusion that it's time for your first fight.
